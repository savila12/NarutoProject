# NarutoProject

# About Project:

- This project displays a list of anime show/movies. This project was to show what we know so far from our iOS training

- With a MVVM approach, this allowed the project to stay organized and keep the business logic out of the views. 
- To get the data, native RESTful API calls were used. 
- To display the data, the project used a collection view. 

- A Third Library, SDWebImage was used to get the images and to cache them
